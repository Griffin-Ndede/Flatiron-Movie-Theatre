# Description
The program displays a list of movies on the page as well as a default movie poster with the movie details. On clicking on any movie on the list, the movie details and poster for the particular movie pop up in the place of the default movie poster and details. The program also monitors the number of tickets sold per movie and once the capacity of the cinema is exceeded, as movie tickets are bought, it displays the message sold out.
